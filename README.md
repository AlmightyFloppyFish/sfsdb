# Simple File-System Database

## Features
 * No runtime dependencies or external configuration
 * High performance, Just run the benchmarks!
 * Optional caching, Automatically managed for a free performance boost at no usage cost
 * Optional indexing, Bundle index data together with your saves and [query them with the Rust language itself](https://github.com/AlmightyFloppyFish/sfsdb/blob/master/examples/indexed.rs#59)

## Status
The library is usable however won't be advertised until all checks under **Todo** are completed. 

### Todo
 - [x] Indexing
 - [x] Write Examples and Benchmarks
 - [x] Improve caching performance (if possible)
 - [x] Make indexes persist after restart (!important)
 - [x] CachedIndexedDB
 - [ ] Documentation
 - [ ] Upload crate!

### Documentation
For now there's [the examples](https://github.com/AlmightyFloppyFish/sfsdb/tree/master/examples).  
`$ git clone https://github.com/AlmightyFloppyFish/sfsdb; cd sfsdb`  
`$ cargo run --release --example simple`  
`$ cargo run --release --example cached`  
`$ cargo run --release --example indexed`  
`$ cargo run --release --example benchmark`
